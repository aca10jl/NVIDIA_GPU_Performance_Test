[P2P (Peer-to-Peer) GPU Bandwidth Latency Test]
Device: 0, Tesla V100-SXM2-16GB, pciBusID: 6, pciDeviceID: 0, pciDomainID:0

***NOTE: In case a device doesn't have P2P access to other one, it falls back to normal memcopy procedure.
So you can see lesser Bandwidth (GB/s) and unstable Latency (us) in those cases.
